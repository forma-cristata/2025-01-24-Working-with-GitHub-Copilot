# AVL Tree Implementation and Simple Games

This C# solution consists of multiple projects demonstrating data structures and game development:

## AVL Tree

An implementation of a self-balancing binary search tree with the following features:

- Generic type support
- Insert and Delete operations
- Search functionality
- In-order tree traversal

## Games

The solution includes two simple console games selected from the following options:

- Typing Speed Test - A game that measures typing speed and accuracy
- Hangman - A word guessing game with limited chances

## Project Structure

Each component is implemented as a separate console project within the solution. The implementation utilizes GitHub Copilot for code generation and assistance.
